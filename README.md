Hello Odin!
How have you been? It's been so long since we last met. I missed you. I hope you can forgive me and we can move on. I want us to work
together towards a better future for our people. I have my army well-prepared and I hope yours are as well. Next year, we go to war. As
a token of friendship, I will lend you 10,000 elephants, 50,000 horses and 100,000 fully armed men. I look forward to your honest response.

Your life-long rival
